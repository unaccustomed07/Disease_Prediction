🧬 AI/ML-Based Disease Prediction Using DNA Sequencing

This project is an AI/ML-powered disease prediction system that uses DNA sequencing data to assess an individual's genetic risk for specific diseases — currently focused on cardiac arrest. The system analyzes raw DNA sequences, extracts biologically relevant features (such as mutation markers, GC content, and k-mer frequencies), and uses trained machine learning models to provide real-time disease risk predictions.
The project is designed to be modular, scalable, and suitable for integration into precision medicine platforms. It serves as a prototype for future development in personalized healthcare, including applications in drug response prediction, genetic screening, and clinical decision support systems.
